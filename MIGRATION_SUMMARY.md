## 🎯 Quick Start

For the fastest migration experience:

1. **Export your data:**
   ```powershell
   ./scripts/export-database-data.ps1
   ```

2. **Fix compatibility issues:**
   ```powershell
   ./scripts/fix-data-compatibility.ps1
   ```

3. **Apply schema to cloud:**
   - Copy `supabase/migrations/20241210000000_complete_database_migration.sql`
   - Paste in Supabase Cloud SQL Editor
   - Run it

4. **Migrate auth users:**
   ```powershell
   ./scripts/migrate-auth-users.ps1 -ProjectUrl "https://your-project.supabase.co" -ServiceKey "your-key"
   ```

5. **Import application data:**
   - Use files from `migration_data_fixed/` directory
   - Import in dependency order (see migration guide)

6. **Verify migration:**
   ```powershell
   ./scripts/verify-migration.ps1 -ProjectUrl "https://your-project.supabase.co" -ServiceKey "your-key"
   ```

## 🔍 What Was Fixed

### Schema Issues Addressed
- ✅ **Missing tables** - Added `clients_meta`, `google_drive_integrations`, `gmail_watch_subscriptions`, etc.
- ✅ **Field differences** - Fixed `clients` table to use `first_name`/`last_name` instead of `name`
- ✅ **Missing enum types** - Added all gender, ethnicity, and other enum types
- ✅ **RLS policies** - Complete Row Level Security policies included
- ✅ **Indexes and triggers** - All performance optimizations included

### Data Migration Features
- ✅ **Dependency handling** - Proper import order for foreign key relationships
- ✅ **Auth preservation** - User IDs maintained to preserve relationships
- ✅ **Data validation** - Verification queries to ensure integrity
- ✅ **Error handling** - Graceful handling of migration issues

## 📊 Migration Approach Comparison

| Approach | Best For | Time | Complexity | Risk |
|----------|----------|------|------------|------|
| **Manual Recreation** | <20 users, dev | 2-3 hours | Low | Low |
| **Script Migration** | >20 users, prod | 3-5 hours | Medium | Medium |
| **Full Automation** | Large datasets | 4-8 hours | High | Medium |

## 🛠️ Tool Features

### Export Script Features
- Exports all table data as INSERT statements
- Exports auth users as CSV
- Creates dependency-ordered import script
- Handles PostgreSQL client requirements

### Compatibility Fixer Features  
- Converts `name` field to `first_name`/`last_name`
- Creates fixed seed data
- Provides transformation scripts
- Preserves all other data

### Auth Migration Features
- Uses Supabase Admin API
- Preserves user UUIDs
- Handles metadata migration
- Supports dry-run mode
- Batch password reset emails

### Verification Features
- Schema integrity checks
- Data count validation
- Foreign key relationship tests
- RLS policy verification
- Auth integration testing
- Generates verification SQL file

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Before Migration
- [[memory:3443473]] Never reset the database - print SQL statements instead
- Keep local Supabase running until verification complete
- Document current user credentials for testing
- Take note of sensitive tokens (don't migrate them)

### Security Considerations
- All migrated users get temporary passwords
- Force password resets for security
- Verify RLS policies work correctly
- Test authentication thoroughly

### Performance Tips
- Import data during low-traffic periods
- Monitor cloud database performance
- Verify indexes are created properly
- Test under expected load

## 🔄 Rollback Strategy

If migration fails:
1. Keep local database running (backup)
2. Revert environment variables to local
3. Document issues for retry
4. Contact support if needed

## 📞 Support

- **Script Issues:** Check output logs and error messages
- **Supabase Issues:** [Supabase Support](https://supabase.com/support)
- **Database Issues:** [PostgreSQL Docs](https://postgresql.org/docs/)

## ✨ Success Indicators

Your migration is successful when:
- ✅ All application features work with cloud database
- ✅ Users can authenticate and access their data  
- ✅ Performance meets your requirements
- ✅ No data integrity issues found
- ✅ Team can access new environment
